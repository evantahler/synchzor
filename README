SynchZor

SynchZor is a minimal ruby project that aims to emulate drop-box like functionality by synching files and folders across multiple computers.

Features:
- no extra software to install on the server (just SSH, SFTP)
- uses unix user management on server
- favors updates, is safe about deletes
- not versioned (to safe time and space)
- no metadata files or folders created in your project
- logged


I can be scheduled using cron or OSX playlists

Install:
- git-pull this project into ~/.synch
- update .bashrc to alias 'synch' to '~/.synch/synch'

I will create a sqlite database within ~/.synch which will store files and folders the synch process should manage

At this time, I currently only work over SFTP... but this is all open source, so perhaps someone will add another type of storage!



setup:
- git pull
- rvm gemset create 'synchzor'
- rvm install ruby-1.9.2-p180
- cd ..
- cd .synchzor
- gem install bundler
- bundle install


adding example:
  rake synchzor:add local_folder=/Users/evantahler/Desktop/test_folder remote_folder=/home/theyellowdart/synchzor/test_folder username=theyellowdart host=### password=###

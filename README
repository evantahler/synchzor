SynchZor

*** vist http://synchzor.com for more information ***

SynchZor is a ruby project that aims to emulate DropBox-like functionality by synching files and folders across multiple computers. This tool is suited for making backups and for for sharing files and folders.

Features:
- you own the server; you own the data!
- no central account server/service.
- no fees (just your server)
- no extra software to install on the server (just SSH and SFTP needed)
- uses unix user management on server
- favors updates, is safe about deletes
- uploaded files are not versioned (to save time and space)
- no metadata files or folders created in your project (data stored in sqlite database on your machine)
- files stored on server in accessible manner with folder hierarchy maintained
- does not require a running dameon
- logged

Requirements:
- Ruby 1.8.7+
- Bundler
- unix/linux/osx

setup:
    1) git pull / unzip this repository anywhere you would like (~/.synchzor is a common choice)
    2) cd into the directory you copied synchzor into
    3) ensure that you have ruby installed on your system
    3) gem install bundler
    4) bundle install
    5) create an alias to the synchzor executable in your ~/.bashrc file for easy access.  For example: alias synchzor='/Users/evantahler/.synchzor/synchzor'
    6) profit!

If you want sychzor to constantly run (like DropBox), you might consider adding a crontab entry for synchzor [[ * * * * * ~/.synchzor/synchzor local_folder=Path/to/synch/folder ]]
a log is kept in ~/.synchzor/log/

You can also run the `synchzor all` command to synch all folders synchzor is tracking 

see help.txt or run `synchzor help` for more information

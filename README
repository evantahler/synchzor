SynchZor

SynchZor is a ruby project that aims to emulate DropBox-like functionality by synching files and folders across multiple computers. This tool is suited for making backups, or for sharing files and folders.

Features:
- you own the server; you own the data!
- no central account server/service.
- no fees (just your server)
- no extra software to install on the server (just SSH and SFTP needed)
- uses unix user management on server
- favors updates, is safe about deletes
- uploaded files are not versioned (to save time and space)
- no metadata files or folders created in your project (data stored in sqlite database on your machine)
- files stored on server in accessible manner with folder hierarchy maintained
- logged

Requirements:
- Ruby 1.8.7+
- Bundler

I can be run on request (like git or svn), or I can be scheduled using cron or OSX playlists.
